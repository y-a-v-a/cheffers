Loop With Multiple Verb-Pattern Instructions.

This recipe tests that loop bodies can contain multiple instructions matching
"Verb the ingredient" pattern (like "Clean", "Liquefy") which could be
mistaken for loop starts but are actually regular instructions.

This exercises the parser fix for handling loop-like patterns in loop bodies
that don't have matching "until" statements.
